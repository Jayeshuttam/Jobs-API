The API is completed.
It is live on Heroku,
It has no front-end .however I have implemented SWAGGER UI  for testing all routes of the API
check it out on :  https://jobs-api-7844.herokuapp.com/


You can also run it on localhost all the test cases have been tested on POSTMAN and for live server through SWAGGER UI

for localhost you have to setup the following things:
1.MONG_URI
2.JWT_SECRET
3.JWT_LIFETIME







#### Setup

```bash
npm install && node app.js
```

#### Database Connection

1. Import connect.js
2. Invoke in start()
3. Setup .env in the root
4. Add MONGO_URI with correct value
